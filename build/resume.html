			<p>
				<strong>Software Architect</strong> with <strong>20 years of experience</strong> creating content
				for the web. I am a full stack developer, building everything from the back-end server architecture and database 
				design to the page layouts and dynamic front-end interactions. I have constructed sites of all sizes, from <strong>single page
				applications</strong> to large multi-page cross-domain <strong>CMS</strong> engines and <strong>e-commerce</strong> storefronts.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is very little which I cannot accomplish in a browser, and I have a strong passion for creating new
				experiences on the web. I am highly attentive to detail in my user interfaces and have an innate intuition for
				good <strong>UX design</strong>. I am fastidious towards <strong>clean code</strong>, architectural organization
				and <strong>code maintainability</strong>, with a focus on simplicity.  Finally, I highly value self education
				and the distribution of knowledge.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have almost five years experience as a <strong>remote worker</strong> from my home office, using online communication
				systems such as instant messaging, IRC, Skype and Google Hangouts for <strong>team collaboration</strong>. I firmly
				believe in the power of fully virtualized teams to create streamlined and highly efficient environments.  My ideal
				position would be <strong>leading a team</strong> of remote developers to build a new product from the ground up.

				<h2>Mash.li <em><a href="http://mash.li">http://mash.li</a></em></h2>
				<p>
					Mash.li is a content aggregate site built on top of the SoundCloud API. It scrapes the SoundCloud system
					for new tracks tagged as music mashups, and then queues them for regular release.  Each day the site picks
					ten tracks at random from the queue and adds them to the top of the list, where visitors can listen to them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mash.li is written 100% in JavaScript on a NodeJS backend with a RequireJS, Backbone &amp; Handlebars driven
					front-end. The codebase makes extensive use of Grunt tooling to manage front-end optimization for fast page
					loads. The entire codebase is made available as open source via GitHub.
				</p>

				<h2>Kalendae <em><a href="http://kalendaejs.com">http://kalendaejs.com</a></em></h2>
				<p>
					Kalendae is a JavaScript date picker library written out of frustration with all other date pickers. The
					library is entirely self-contained and does not depend on any other DOM manipulation libraries such as
					jQuery or Prototype.js.  It supports multiple types of date selection, including range selection, and is
					fully skinnable through CSS.

			<dt>Experience</dt>
			<dd>
				<h2>Valuation Vision <em>Senior Engineer, Technology Consultant - October 2013 to Present</em></h2>
				<p>
					I was hired by the V2 development team to help with application scaling and architectural concerns as the
					company's product demands increased.  Within the company I have served as a driving force in migrating to
					newer technologies and teaching more maintainable development techniques.  Since joining the team I have
					helped to build new systems using Node.js, overhauled the dashboard data visualizations, and improved page
					performance in multiple places.  I introduced regular training sessions to educate the team on the use of
					tools such as Backbone and Handlebars for managing front-end code structure.
				</p>

				<h2>Synacor, Inc <em>Senior Frontend Engineer, Project Lead - January 2013 to October 2013</em></h2>
				<p>
					Responsible for developing new features on Synacor's TV Everywhere media portal product. This primarily
					consisted of the creation of new JavaScript libraries and JS driven front-end components used to make up page
					layouts, as well as the creation of HTML templates and CSS styling to shape those elements.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I departed Synacor I was serving as a team leader on the version three total rewrite of the product,
					built on a Java backend using Service Oriented Architecture. I created the front-end framework for loading
					Backbone Views dynamically using hooks in the HTML, and a Grunt driven LESS compile process for selectively
					aggregating component css.
				</p>
				<p>
					This position was fully remote from my home in San Diego, communicating with my team members in Buffalo, New
					York via company chat and Skype.  Synacor has a strong unit testing policy (PHPUnit, Jasmine and QUnit) and
					uses Agile project management.
				</p>

				<h2>NFY Interactive, inc. <em>Senior Web Developer - 2008 to 2012</em></h2>
				<p>
					Solely built and deployed entire web driven applications for third party clients based upon application needs
					determined by project managers, and graphic designs provided by either our in-house designer or by the client.
					This was a full stack development position and included designing MySQL databases, constructing backend
					infrastructure in PHP, breaking out design compositions into HTML and CSS layouts, and writing any client side
					Javascript to drive dynamic elements on the site.<br>
					<br>
					Some of the sites I have built while working at NFY:
				</p>
				<ul class="two-column">
					<li>idoc.org</li>
					<li>bedrosians.com</li>
					<li>cielorsf.com</li>
					<li>aerolist.org</li>
					<li>aeixrrg.com</li>
					<li>frontporch.net</li>
					<li class="full">walnutvillage.org and the 11 other Front Porch Community sites (custom centralized CMS)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>NFY virtualized in 2010, moving all employees to remote work positions.</p>

				<h2>Abtech Systems <em>Systems Technician - Carlsbad, CA - 2007 to 2008</em></h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Built, refurbished, configured and troubleshot HP &amp; Compaq Servers and Workstations running both Microsoft Windows and HP-UX Unix. </li>
					<li>Responsible for testing all components and systems prior to shipment to customers. </li>
					<li>Interacted with salesmen to fulfill customerʼs needs and expectations.</li>
                </ul>

				<h2>WebOS.com<em> Front-end Developer- Columbia, MD - 2000 to 2001</em></h2>
				<p>
					Telecommuting from my home in San Diego, I worked with a team of programmers based out of Maryland to design a JavaScript
					implementation of the Java Swing API for building real-world applications in the web browser. The work we conducted established
					the foundations of techniques and systems employed in Google's earliest applications and in the Palm/HP webOS.  We were doing
					AJAX six years before the term existed.
