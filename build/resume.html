				<h2>Queryize <em><a href="http://queryizejs.com">http://queryizejs.com</a></em></h2>
				<p>
					Queryize is a chainable query builder for MySQL on NodeJS. Built to serve as a lightweight alternative to full ORM
					stacks, Queryize makes it easy to construct complex queries programatically, while using bound parameters for proper
					data escapement.  The website for QueryizeJS is an online API reference generated from JSDoc comments in the Queryize
					source code itself.
				</p>

				<h2>Kalendae <em><a href="http://kalendaejs.com">http://kalendaejs.com</a></em></h2>
				<p>
					Kalendae is a JavaScript date picker library written out of frustration with all other date pickers. The
					library is entirely self-contained and does not depend on any other DOM manipulation libraries such as
					jQuery or Prototype.js.  It supports multiple types of date selection, including range selection, and is
					fully skinnable through CSS.
				</p>

				<h2>Mash.li <em><a href="http://mash.li">http://mash.li</a></em></h2>
				<p>
					Mash.li is a content aggregate site built on top of the SoundCloud API. It scrapes the SoundCloud system
					for new tracks tagged as music mashups, and then queues them for regular release.  Each day the site picks
					ten tracks at random from the queue and adds them to the top of the list, where visitors can listen to them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mash.li is written 100% in JavaScript on a NodeJS backend with a RequireJS, Backbone &amp; Handlebars driven
					front-end. The codebase makes extensive use of Grunt tooling to manage front-end optimization for fast page
					loads. The entire codebase is made available as open source via GitHub.
				</p>

				<h2>ChiperSoft.com <em><a href="https://github.com/ChiperSoft/chipersoft.com">https://github.com/ChiperSoft/chipersoft.com</a></em></h2>
				<p>
					My own tech blog is a static site built using a custom written gulp.js process.  Multiple gulp plugins work
					in congress to build the markdown, less and handlebars template files that make up the source material,
					compiling them all together into static content served by GitHub Pages.
				</p>

				<h2>Dox <em><a href="https://github.com/tj/dox">https://github.com/tj/dox</a></em></h2>
				<p>
					Dox is a JSDoc parsing library built by TJ Holowaychuk which reads JavaScript source files and outputs a JSON
					structure representing the contents of the comments contained inside.
				</p>
				<p>
					In September of 2014 I underwent a large project to pool together all of the pending pull requests against
					the project and add missing use-cases for situations that the library did not know how to handle.
					I then petitioned the project's current maintainer to merge this changed, closing 10 pull requests and 4 issues.
					This comprised the bulk of the 0.5.0 release of the library.

				<h2>Valuation Vision <em>Senior Engineer, Technology Consultant - October 2013 to Present</em></h2>
				<p>
					I was hired by the V2 development team to help with application scaling and architectural concerns as the
					company's product demands increased.  Within the company I have served as a driving force in migrating to
					newer technologies and teaching more maintainable development techniques via regular training sessions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since joining the team, I have been instrumental in efforts to modernize and clean up the codebase,
					introducing the use of Backbone and Handlebars to simplify our front-end logic. I spearheaded the introduction
					of Node.js into our development stack in order to drive the realtime aspects of the application, including a
					websocket powered realtime order pipeline.  I also introduced the team to d3.js for creating dynamic visualizations
					of our application data, and trained my teammates in its use.
				</p>

				<h2>Synacor, Inc <em>Senior Frontend Engineer, Project Lead - January 2013 to October 2013</em></h2>
				<p>
					Responsible for developing new features on Synacor's TV Everywhere media portal product. This primarily
					consisted of the creation of new JavaScript libraries and JS driven front-end components used to make up page
					layouts, as well as the creation of HTML templates and CSS styling to shape those elements.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I departed Synacor I was serving as a team leader on the version three total rewrite of the product,
					built on a Java backend using Service Oriented Architecture. I created the front-end framework for loading
					Backbone Views dynamically using hooks in the HTML, and a Grunt driven LESS compile process for selectively
					aggregating component css.
				</p>
				<p>
					This position was fully remote from my home in San Diego, communicating with my team members in Buffalo, New
					York via company chat and Skype.  Synacor has a strong unit testing policy (PHPUnit, Jasmine and QUnit) and
					uses Agile project management.
				</p>

				<h2>NFY Interactive, inc. <em>Senior Web Developer - 2008 to 2012</em></h2>
				<p>
					Solely built and deployed nearly two dozen custom CMS applications for third party clients.
					This was a full stack development position and included designing MySQL databases, constructing backend
					infrastructure in PHP, breaking out design compositions into HTML and CSS layouts, and writing any client side
					Javascript to drive dynamic elements on the site.
				</p>

				<h2>Abtech Systems <em>Systems Technician - Carlsbad, CA - 2007 to 2008</em></h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Built, refurbished, configured and troubleshot HP &amp; Compaq Servers and Workstations running both Microsoft Windows and HP-UX Unix. </li>
					<li>Responsible for testing all components and systems prior to shipment to customers. </li>
					<li>Worked with salesmen to fulfill customerʼs needs and expectations.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>WebOS.com<em> Front-end Developer- Columbia, MD - 2000 to 2001</em></h2>
				<p>
					Telecommuting from my home in San Diego, I worked with a team of programmers based out of Maryland to design a JavaScript
					implementation of the Java Swing API for building real-world applications in the web browser. The work we conducted established
					the foundations of techniques and systems employed in Google's earliest applications and in the Palm/HP webOS.  We were doing
					AJAX six years before the term existed.
