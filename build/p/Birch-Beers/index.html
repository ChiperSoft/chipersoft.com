			<div class="post-content"><h2 id="first-a-little-story">First, a little story</h2>
<p>When I was growing up as a kid in Michigan, every summer my Mom and I would spend 3-6 weeks on <a href="http://www.beaverisland.org">an island in the northern part of Lake Michigan</a>.  It was easily the highlight of every year and an experience I sadly wont be able to duplicate for my children.  While on this island there was a particular beverage that I never found in my home town: <a href="http://www.whiterockbeverages.com/SiouxCity.cfm">Sioux City Birch Beer</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch_beer">Birch Beer</a> is a carbonated soda beverage made from the sap of the birch tree.  It has a very similar taste to most root beers, except with a bit more bite.  It originates in Pennsylvania but is sold all over the north-eastern United States.  Different species of Birch tree produce different flavors.  Since moving to California I&#39;ve not seen any type of birch beer in stores, and indeed I&#39;ve found most SoCal residents have never heard of it.  </p>
<h2 id="finding-a-dealer">Finding a dealer</h2>
<p>A few months ago I watched an awesome documentary on the food network about <a href="https://www.sodapopstop.com">Galcos Soda Pop Stop</a>, a store in Anaheim that specializes in only carbonated beverages.  After checking out their website, sure enough, they had sioux city birch beer... and a whole bunch of other birch beers that I had never heard of.  Initially I bought an entire case of the drink from my childhood (and paid a hefty shipping fee to get them down to San Diego).  I drank it slowly, rationing my supply so I could enjoy it as much as possible.  </p>
<p>After finishing the case I was left somewhat disappointed.  Don&#39;t take me wrong, it&#39;s still delicious, but at some point in the last 20 years the manufacturer switched from cane sugar to high fructose corn syrup.  The flavor is ruined, it&#39;s now sickly sweet, like the difference between Coke and Pepsi.  This could just be the result of nothing tasting as good as your memory of the taste, but regardless I was left without the flavor I wanted.</p>
<p>This month I decided to perform an experiment.  I ordered a single bottle of every variety of birch beer that Galcos sells (excluding diet varieties), and tried each of them one by one to see which I liked the most.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>Some of the flavors really didn&#39;t work for me, so I&#39;m only going to talk about my four favorites.</p>
<p>My very favorite of the lot was <a href="https://www.sodapopstop.com/products/detail.cfm?link=690">Kutztown Birch Beer</a>.  <a href="http://www.kutztownbottlingworks.com">Kutztown</a> is a 171 year old soda manufacturer in Pennsylvania that specializes in brewed sodas, so it&#39;s no surprise that they know how to make a good birch beer.  They use pure cane sugar as a sweetener, and the soda had just the right balance of sappy bite and sweetness.</p>
<p>Second runner up was <a href="https://www.sodapopstop.com/products/detail.cfm?link=624">Pennsylvania Dutch Birch Beer</a>.  PD does contain HFCS, but surprisingly was not very sweet.  In fact, the reason it lost first place was because it tasted more like a root beer than a birch beer, too much bite and not enough birch.  It appears to be the only drink made under the 76 year old <a href="http://www.daretogodutch.com/homepage.html">Pennsylvania Dutch</a> brand.</p>
<p>In third place was <a href="https://www.sodapopstop.com/products/detail.cfm?link=1029">Foxon Park White Birch</a>.  This is a clear birch beer made with cane sugar, and is most notable as being the only birch beer I tried which actually had a wood taste.  It literally tasted like a birch tree, which was surprising but not unpleasant.  The label proudly states that it is caffeine free, but this is a misnome as all birch beers are caffeine free.  It&#39;s made by <a href="http://www.foxonpark.com">Foxon Park Beverages</a>, an 80 year old Connecticut based company.  Foxon makes a number of other delicious looking sodas that I&#39;ll probably trying in the future.</p>
<p>The final runner up was <a href="https://www.sodapopstop.com/products/detail.cfm?link=86">Hanks Genuine Gourmet Birch Beer</a>.  It&#39;s a cane sugar variety that had good flavor, but didn&#39;t stand out as superb.</p>
<p>My next soda experiment will be Sarsparillas, another category of soda that Sioux City is well known for.</p>
