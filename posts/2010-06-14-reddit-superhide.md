I'm getting the hang of this extension thing.  Second release, a port of mine and another developer's GreaseMonkey scripts:  Reddit SuperHide.<

It does two things: First, it moves all hide buttons to a standard location between the vote arrows and the thumbnail, rotating it to take up little space.  This position is uniform for all entries on the page, unlike the normal position which moves around depending on how long the title is and how many comments the thread has.

The second function adds a Hide All button to the top of the page to quickly hide all items at once.
