Introducing my first Safari Extension, RedditChecker.

![](http://i.imgur.com/UFr8t.png)

It provides a single button on your toolbar and checks at regular intervals to see if you have new messages in your inbox.  If you do, clicking the button takes you to your unread inbox, otherwise it takes you to the Reddit front page.

Note: Because of the way Reddit is setup, you must disable the "Mark my messages as read when I open my mailbox.." option in your account preferences.  Otherwise this extension will constantly be unsetting them when it checks.

Don't have an official page for it yet, but you can download it here: [RedditChecker.safariextz](http://files.chipersoft.com/RedditChecker.safariextz.zip)
