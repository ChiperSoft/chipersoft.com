> linxeh: I dont see the point in battling against SVN or similar now git is ubiqutous (and powerful)
> deryl: SVN is wanna-be git on drugs
> deryl: bad drugs
> linxeh: well, it was better than much else at the time 
> linxeh: at least it supported changesets 
> FylGood: SVN is kinda like Nethandrahal man, just becoming upright, but definitely lacking in many ways. 
> chiper: SVN is like the salt & pepper shakers, and git is a full spice rack
> chiper: for some people, a little salt is all it needs
> ibiwan: so where's CVS and VSS fit into your analogy?
> chiper: ibiwan: salt & pepper has to come from somewhere
> ibiwan: I think CVS must be a bowl of peppercorns
> chiper: indeed
> ibiwan: and VSS is a beautiful crystal vial of powdered dog shit
> chiper: ibiwan: that costs $50 per gram
> FylGood: Next time I'm in a job interview, if they ask me to tell them about my experience with CVS...  I'll just say "it's basically a bowl of peppercorns".  :p
> chiper: haha
> ibiwan: and there's only one peppermill for the whole table, and it must be washed out and let air dry between uses
> FylGood: ibiwan: and I would say that if two people try to grab the peppermill at the same time....  (you fill in the rest)
> ibiwan: FylGood: it explodes and gets pepper in everyone's eyes
> ibiwan: in comparison, SVN is downright modern and developer-friendly
> FylGood: lol
> ibiwan: even the ones who weren't reaching for it
> ibiwan: and it's STILL better than VSS
